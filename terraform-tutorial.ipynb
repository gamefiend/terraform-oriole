    "_(Note: This might be a preface for the actual tutorial, but I am just going to include it for now. -QHM)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform is easy to get started with. The simplicity of it's declarative language combined with the power of its providers is one of its features. This project will make getting started with Terraform even easier. You'll spin up a quick and simple web architecture, reshape it and re-deploy, and find ways to make it modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "First though, we need to make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **An AWS Account with permissions to install EC2 instances and VPCs**. We will be making live infrastructure, and you will need an account capable of creating EC2 instances and VPCs. Have your AWS Key and AWS Secret on hand; you'll need it in a moment. _Warning: this can incur charges and fees on your account, so you should take care to remove these machines when you are finished!_\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terraform Installed**. You'll need access to Terraform, which you [can get from Hashicorp's site](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). Follow the instructions and confirm that you have the binary that you need!  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **A Text Editor**. Any text editor you wnat to use will work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access to the command line**. After we edit our files, we will save them and run Terraform from the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your public IP**.  By default we are going to minimize access to the outside world for everything but the ports we want available. You'll provide your public IP address in these exercises to make sure only you have full access to the infrastructure.\n",
